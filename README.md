# Amazon-Clone
This project is a clone of the Amazon homepage created using HTML and CSS. It replicates the look and feel of Amazon's homepage, showcasing various elements such as the navigation bar, product grid, and footer. The goal of this project was to practice front-end web development skills, including responsive design and CSS layout techniques.
